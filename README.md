# Data Visualisation in R - Jake Riley 

**Workshop Description**

This workshop will cover some more advanced topics of data visualization in R, specifically focusing on the ggplot2 package. Topics will cover common troubles with ggplot (e.g. sorting in descending order), tips and tricks (e.g. facet_grid margins),  and best practices. Some familiarity with R and ggplot2 will be useful and expected, but not required.
